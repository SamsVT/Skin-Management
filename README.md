**CatSkinC** is a lightweight, client-side Minecraft mod that makes uploading and switching skins quick and seamless.  
Unlike the vanilla system, CatSkinC supports **HD skins up to 8192×8192**, instant previews, and changing your look without restarting the game.  

It is designed for players, artists, and communities who want more customization and flexibility than Mojang’s default skin service.

## 🔒 Disclaimer

CatSkinC is an **independent skin system**, completely separate from Mojang’s official skin service.  
It does not replace or modify your Mojang account skin. Instead, it works as an **alternative client-side option** for those who want HD skins, instant switching, or more flexibility.  

Your official Mojang skin will remain untouched — CatSkinC simply gives you another way to express yourself.
